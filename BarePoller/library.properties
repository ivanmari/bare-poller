sentence=A polling library for bare metal systems, providing non-blocking timers and switch debouncing.
paragraph=This library implements non-blocking timers (PrecisionTimer) and debounced digital input handling (Switch) suitable for loop-based programming models common in Arduino and other bare-metal environments. It avoids the use of interrupts and delays, allowing for more responsive applications. It also includes a Blinker utility class.
